Abstract:
This report is conducted in order to set the foundations upon which the final project. The title of the project is: “Food Billing System” and is supervised by Mrs.Pooja. The main target of this report is to conduct a thorough and in-depth analysis of the vast field of Software engineering and at the same time explore the opportunities and the conditions that could lead into building a successful Android app.
INTRODUCTION:
The traditional system is a restaurant paper menu and ordering system is replaced with an electronic medium i.e. a digital tablet. Due to a digitalized system, the risk of manual errors is eliminated, thus eliminating the communication barrier. The tablet displays all the information the customer needs to know about the order he has placed. This self-service fast food restaurant will be equipped with a user-friendly touch screen, a credit/debit card reader, and software for completing the process at the backend. For this system there will be a system administrator who will have the rights to enter the menu with their current prevailing prices. He/she can enter anytime in the system by a secured system password to change the menu contents by adding or deleting an item or changing its price. Now when the customer enters the restaurant, he will place his order with the help of the touch screen using the intuitive graphical user interface, right from the selection of language till the payment confirmation. He will select from the food options according to his choice and the system will display the payment amount he has to make once he has finished with his order.
OBJECTIVES:
1.This will minimize the number of employees at the back of the counter.
